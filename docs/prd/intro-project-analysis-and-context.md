# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis

**Current Project State**: 
CollabCanvas is a real-time collaborative canvas application built with Next.js 15, react-konva, and Supabase. The system currently provides:
- Real-time collaborative canvas with rectangle/ellipse creation and manipulation
- Multi-user ownership system with claim/release functionality
- Live multiplayer cursors and presence awareness
- User authentication and session management
- Canvas operations service with optimistic UI updates
- Dual-channel real-time sync (broadcast + database subscriptions)

## Available Documentation Analysis

✅ **Tech Stack Documentation** - Available in memory-bank/techContext.md
✅ **Source Tree/Architecture** - Available in memory-bank/systemPatterns.md  
✅ **API Documentation** - Available in lib/canvas/CanvasOperations.ts
✅ **External API Documentation** - Supabase integration documented
✅ **Technical Debt Documentation** - Available in memory-bank/progress.md
✅ **UX/UI Guidelines** - Available in components/ structure
✅ **Other**: Pong pivot concept, technical architecture, and epic documentation

**Assessment**: Excellent documentation foundation exists for this brownfield enhancement.

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: 
✅ **New Feature Addition** - Adding game mode functionality
✅ **Integration with New Systems** - Matter.js physics engine integration
✅ **Performance/Scalability Improvements** - Physics loop optimization

**Enhancement Description**: 
Transform the existing collaborative canvas into a Pong-style game where canvas objects become interactive obstacles. Users will create obstacles on the canvas, start a game mode, control a paddle with arrow keys, and win by converting all obstacles to green through ball collision.

**Impact Assessment**:
✅ **Moderate Impact** - Some existing code changes required
- Extends canvas_objects table with game_properties JSONB column
- Adds new real-time event types for game mechanics
- Creates game mode alongside existing canvas mode
- Integrates Matter.js physics engine with react-konva

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Transform CollabCanvas from design tool to collaborative gaming platform
- Leverage existing real-time collaboration infrastructure for unique gaming experience
- Create single-player Pong game where canvas objects become interactive obstacles
- Maintain existing canvas functionality while adding game capabilities
- Establish foundation for future PvP multiplayer gaming features

**Background Context**:
This enhancement addresses the opportunity to pivot CollabCanvas into a unique gaming experience that combines design and gameplay. The existing architecture is perfectly positioned to support this evolution - the real-time collaboration system, canvas operations service, and database schema can be extended to support game mechanics without disrupting current functionality. The enhancement leverages the existing object manipulation system, ownership management, and real-time event system to create a seamless transition between canvas design mode and game mode.
