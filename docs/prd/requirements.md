# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The existing CollabCanvas will integrate a new game mode alongside the current canvas mode without breaking existing functionality.

**FR2:** Users will be able to create obstacles on the canvas using existing rectangle and ellipse tools, with these objects automatically becoming game obstacles when game mode is activated.

**FR3:** The system will provide a "Start Game" button in the existing toolbar that switches from canvas mode to game mode, locking the viewport to prevent pan/zoom during gameplay.

**FR4:** Game mode will display a horizontal paddle (100px wide Ã— 20px tall) positioned 5% above the bottom edge of the viewport that users can control with left/right arrow keys at 8 pixels per frame movement speed.

**FR5:** A ball (20px radius) will spawn 50px above the paddle and move with realistic physics at 6 pixels per frame initial speed, bouncing off obstacles, paddle, and viewport edges with perfect restitution.

**FR6:** When the ball collides with an obstacle, the obstacle will change color to green and apply a random effect (speed boost, speed reduction, or neutral bounce).

**FR7:** The game will end when either all visible obstacles are converted to green (win condition) or the ball falls through the bottom edge of the viewport (lose condition).

**FR8:** The system will maintain existing real-time collaboration features, allowing multiple users to see each other's cursors and presence during both canvas and game modes.

**FR9:** Users will be able to switch back to canvas mode after a game ends, with all obstacle color changes preserved.

**FR10:** The system will provide visual feedback for game events including collision effects, score updates, and win/lose notifications.

**FR11:** The system must support a minimum of 30+ obstacles for gameplay to begin, with no maximum limit for obstacle count.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The physics engine must maintain smooth performance during gameplay without impacting existing canvas mode performance.

**NFR2:** Game mode must be completely optional and can be disabled via feature flag without affecting existing canvas functionality.

**NFR3:** Real-time synchronization for game events must maintain sub-100ms latency for smooth multiplayer experience.

**NFR4:** The system must gracefully handle network disconnections during gameplay with automatic reconnection and state recovery.

**NFR5:** Game state must be persisted to the database for session recovery and future PvP implementation.

**NFR6:** The physics engine must be deterministic to ensure consistent gameplay across different clients.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1:** Existing canvas operations API must remain functional - all current create, update, delete, and manipulation functions must continue working, but data structure changes are acceptable to support game functionality.

**CR2:** Database schema changes must be backward compatible - adding game_properties JSONB column to existing canvas_objects table without affecting existing queries or functionality.

**CR3:** UI changes must follow existing patterns - game mode integration must use existing toolbar, layout, and component structure without breaking current design system.

**CR4:** Integration compatibility must be maintained - existing real-time event system, ownership management, and authentication must continue working without modification.
