# Summary

This PRD defines a comprehensive brownfield enhancement that transforms CollabCanvas into a collaborative Pong-style game. The enhancement leverages existing architecture while adding game mechanics through three sequential stories that minimize risk to the current system.

**Key Success Factors**:
- Maintains existing canvas functionality throughout the enhancement
- Uses proven Matter.js physics engine for reliable game mechanics
- Follows existing patterns for seamless integration
- Provides clear rollback strategy through feature flags
- Establishes foundation for future PvP multiplayer features

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and approve this PRD
2. Begin implementation with Story 1.1 (Physics Engine Integration)
3. Validate each story's integration verification criteria
4. Prepare for future PvP enhancement based on this foundation
