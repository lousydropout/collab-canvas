# Story 1.1: Physics Engine Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to integrate Matter.js physics engine with the existing react-konva canvas system,
**so that** canvas objects can have realistic physics properties and collision detection.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Existing canvas objects can be converted to physics bodies using the defined obstacle configuration
3. Physics engine runs independently from canvas mode with 60fps target (16.666ms delta)
4. Basic collision detection is working between objects with proper restitution and friction settings
5. Physics calculations don't interfere with existing canvas operations
6. Physics engine can be initialized and destroyed without affecting canvas state
7. Collision events are properly detected and logged for debugging
