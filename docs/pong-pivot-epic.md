# Epic: Pong Game Pivot - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Transform CollabCanvas into a collaborative Pong-style game where existing canvas objects become interactive obstacles, leveraging the current real-time collaboration infrastructure to create a unique gaming experience that combines design and gameplay.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context:
- **Current Functionality:** Real-time collaborative canvas with rectangle/ellipse creation, manipulation, ownership system, and multiplayer cursors
- **Technology Stack:** Next.js 15, react-konva, Supabase (Auth + Realtime + Database), TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Integration Points:** Canvas operations service, real-time event system, database schema (canvas_objects table), ownership management

### Enhancement Details:
- **What's Being Added:** Game mode with physics engine (Matter.js), ball/paddle mechanics, obstacle collision system, game state management
- **How It Integrates:** Extends existing canvas_objects table with game properties, adds new real-time event types, creates game mode alongside canvas mode
- **Success Criteria:** Single-player Pong game where users create obstacles on canvas, start game mode, control paddle with arrow keys, win by converting all obstacles to green through ball collision

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Physics Engine Integration - Integrate Matter.js physics engine with react-konva canvas system
2. **Story 2:** Game Mode Implementation - Create game mode with ball, paddle, and basic collision detection
3. **Story 3:** Obstacle Effects System - Implement obstacle collision effects and color conversion mechanics

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ **Existing APIs remain unchanged** - Canvas operations API stays intact
- ✅ **Database schema changes are backward compatible** - Add game_properties JSONB column to existing canvas_objects table
- ✅ **UI changes follow existing patterns** - Game mode integrates with existing toolbar and layout
- ✅ **Performance impact is minimal** - Physics engine runs at 60fps, game mode is optional

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Physics engine integration could impact existing canvas performance
- **Mitigation:** Game mode runs separately from canvas mode, physics only active during gameplay
- **Rollback Plan:** Game mode can be disabled via feature flag, physics engine can be removed without affecting canvas functionality

## Definition of Done

- ✅ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Existing canvas functionality verified through testing
- ✅ Game mode integration points working correctly
- ✅ Documentation updated appropriately
- ✅ No regression in existing collaborative canvas features

## Validation Checklist

### Scope Validation:
- ✅ Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
- ✅ No architectural documentation required (technical architecture already exists)
- ✅ Enhancement follows existing patterns (extends current object system)
- ✅ Integration complexity is manageable (additive changes only)

### Risk Assessment:
- ✅ Risk to existing system is low (game mode is additive)
- ✅ Rollback plan is feasible (feature flag disable)
- ✅ Testing approach covers existing functionality
- ✅ Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points

### Completeness Check:
- ✅ Epic goal is clear and achievable
- ✅ Stories are properly scoped
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable
- ✅ Dependencies are identified

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Next.js 15, react-konva, Supabase, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Integration points: Canvas operations service, real-time event system, canvas_objects database table, ownership management
- Existing patterns to follow: Dual-channel real-time sync, optimistic UI updates, ownership claim/release pattern
- Critical compatibility requirements: Existing canvas functionality must remain intact, game mode must be optional
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering a single-player Pong game where users create obstacles on canvas, start game mode, control paddle with arrow keys, and win by converting all obstacles to green through ball collision."
