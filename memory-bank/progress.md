# Progress: CollabCanvas Development Status

## üéâ MVP COMPLETE! ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ **MVP SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED**

All core requirements have been implemented and are working:
- Real-time collaborative canvas
- Multi-user rectangle creation and manipulation
- Live cursor tracking and presence awareness
- Ownership system preventing conflicts
- State persistence across sessions
- Public deployment accessible

## What Works ‚úÖ

### Core Infrastructure
- **Next.js 15 Setup** - App Router with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- **Supabase Integration** - Authentication, database, and real-time services
- **Deployment** - Vercel deployment with environment configuration
- **Database Schema** - Profiles and canvas_objects tables with RLS policies

### Authentication System
- **User Registration** - Email/password signup with display names
- **User Login** - Secure authentication with session management
- **Protected Routes** - Canvas page requires authentication
- **User Profiles** - Display names stored and retrieved

### Canvas Functionality
- **Pan & Zoom** - Smooth canvas navigation (10%-500% zoom range)
- **Shape Creation** - Click and drag to create rectangles and ellipses with color picker
- **Object Selection** - Click to select, shift+click for multi-select
- **Object Transformation** - Drag to move, resize handles via Konva Transformer
- **Object Deletion** - Delete key or button to remove objects
- **Object Duplication** - Ctrl+D to duplicate selected objects

### Real-time Collaboration
- **Object Synchronization** - Create, update, delete operations sync across clients
- **Ownership System** - Claim/release pattern prevents editing conflicts
- **Multiplayer Cursors** - Live cursor tracking with user names and colors
- **Presence Tracking** - Online user count and connection status via modal
- **Dual Channel Architecture** - Broadcast + database subscriptions for optimal performance

### Performance Features
- **Optimized Updates** - Separated broadcast from database operations
- **Throttled Cursors** - 50ms throttling for smooth cursor updates
- **Connection Recovery** - Automatic reconnection with state sync
- **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of connection issues

## Success Criteria Status ‚úÖ

### MVP Requirements - ALL COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Canvas with pan/zoom
- ‚úÖ Shape creation & movement (rectangles and ellipses)
- ‚úÖ Real-time 2+ user sync
- ‚úÖ Multiplayer cursors with labels
- ‚úÖ Online presence list (modal)
- ‚úÖ Auth with display names
- ‚úÖ Public deployment
- ‚úÖ Ownership system prevents conflicts
- ‚úÖ State persists

### Performance Goals - ALL ACHIEVED
- ‚úÖ 60 FPS under load
- ‚úÖ <100ms object sync
- ‚úÖ <50ms cursor sync
- ‚úÖ Handles multiple objects smoothly
- ‚úÖ Supports multiple concurrent users smoothly

## Key Design Decisions Made

### 1. Canvas Library
**Decision:** react-konva (React wrapper for Konva.js)  
**Reason:** Better React integration and component-based architecture

### 2. Color System
**Decision:** Full color picker with react-colorful  
**Reason:** Better user experience and visual distinction

### 3. User List UI
**Decision:** Modal popup triggered by connection status indicator  
**Reason:** Better space utilization and cleaner UI

### 4. Ownership Assignment
**Decision:** Objects start with `owner: creatorUserId`  
**Reason:** Creator automatically owns their objects

### 5. Real-time Architecture
**Decision:** Dual channel system (broadcast + database subscriptions)  
**Reason:** Prevents duplicate event processing and improves performance

### 6. State Management
**Decision:** React hooks only (no external state library)  
**Reason:** Sufficient for MVP complexity, keeps bundle size small

## Recent Improvements ‚úÖ

### Performance Enhancements
- ‚úÖ **Batching System** - Remote broadcasts queued and flushed every 16ms (60fps)
- ‚úÖ **Loop Prevention** - Tracks local operations to avoid infinite loops
- ‚úÖ **Optimized Rendering** - Reduced React re-renders during collaborative sessions

### Bug Fixes
- ‚úÖ **Ownership Claim Bug** - Fixed issue where rejected ownership claims would get stuck in pending state and prevent further claims
- ‚úÖ **Presence Consistency** - Fixed duplicate user counting across browser instances
- ‚úÖ **Channel Management** - Prevented multiple presence channel connections
- ‚úÖ **User Deduplication** - Added logic to prevent same user appearing multiple times

### Feature Additions
- ‚úÖ **Ellipse Support** - Added ellipse creation alongside rectangles
- ‚úÖ **Unified Transformation** - Both shapes use same manipulation system
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Testing** - Added comprehensive testing guides

### Documentation Updates
- ‚úÖ **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation reflecting current status
- ‚úÖ **Testing Guides** - Added BATCHING_TEST_GUIDE.md and PRESENCE_FIX_VERIFICATION.md
- ‚úÖ **Performance Notes** - Added notes about React Strict Mode performance differences

## Next Steps (Post-MVP)
Post-MVP enhancements can be added as needed, but the core collaborative canvas MVP is complete and functional. Potential future enhancements:

### üéÆ Pong Game Pivot (Exploration Phase)
- **Concept**: Transform canvas objects into interactive obstacles for Pong-style gameplay
- **Single Player**: Convert obstacles to green by ball collision, paddle control
- **PvP Mode**: Left vs right gameplay with real-time synchronization
- **Technical**: Matter.js physics engine integration with react-konva
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for single player MVP, 4-6 weeks for PvP

### üèóÔ∏è Prototyping App Builder Pivot (Exploration Phase)
- **Concept**: Transform canvas rectangles into React components for visual app development
- **Component System**: Drag/drop UI components with nesting support
- **Logic Builder**: ID-based data binding with JavaScript code integration
- **AI Generation**: Generate JSX/TSX from visual component tree
- **Deployment**: Dynamic routing (`/username/appname`) with multi-tenant data
- **Technical**: Extend existing canvas objects with component properties
- **Migration**: VERY EASY - database schema 90% ready, only need `parent_id` column

### Traditional Enhancements
- Additional shape tools (circles, text)
- Advanced transformations (rotation)
- Undo/redo functionality
- Mobile responsive design
- Performance optimizations for very large canvases
