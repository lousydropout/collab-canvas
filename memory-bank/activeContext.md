## 🎮 Pong Game Pivot Concept (Exploration Phase)

### **Concept Overview**
Transform CollabCanvas into a collaborative Pong-style game where canvas objects become interactive obstacles. This pivot leverages the existing real-time collaboration infrastructure to create a unique gaming experience.

### **Game Modes**
1. **Single Player Mode**
   - User creates obstacles on canvas (top half of viewport)
   - Click "Start Game" to lock viewport and begin gameplay
   - Horizontal paddle (5% above bottom) controlled by arrow keys
   - Ball starts above paddle
   - Win: Convert all obstacles to green by ball collision
   - Lose: Ball falls through bottom edge

2. **PvP Mode (Future)**
   - Left vs Right gameplay with top/bottom walls
   - Obstacles can have different properties per player
   - Score-based or time-based gameplay
   - Real-time multiplayer synchronization

### **Obstacle Effects System**
- **Basic Effects**: Speed boost/reduce, neutral bounce
- **Angle Effects**: Modified reflection/transmission angles
- **Advanced Effects**: Ball splitting, gravity wells, teleportation
- **Color System**: Random colors → green on collision

### **Technical Architecture Decisions**
- **Physics Engine**: Matter.js (recommended for react-konva integration)
- **Collision Detection**: Leverage Matter.js built-in collision system
- **Real-time Sync**: Extend existing dual-channel architecture
- **Data Persistence**: Game scores and obstacle states in database
- **Performance**: 60fps physics loop with 30fps network sync

### **Implementation Phases**
1. **Phase 1**: Single Player MVP (1-2 weeks)
   - Basic physics engine integration
   - Simple obstacle effects (speed changes)
   - Game flow and win/lose conditions

2. **Phase 2**: Single Player Polish (1 week)
   - Advanced obstacle effects (angle modification)
   - UI polish and game balance
   - Performance optimization

3. **Phase 3**: PvP Foundation (2 weeks)
   - Real-time multiplayer support
   - Game session management
   - Player disconnection handling

4. **Phase 4**: Advanced Features (2-4 weeks)
   - Complex obstacle types
   - Tournament mode
   - Custom level creation

### **Technical Feasibility Assessment**
- **Low Complexity**: Basic physics + simple effects
- **Medium Complexity**: Angle effects + PvP support
- **High Complexity**: Advanced physics + tournament mode

### **Key Technical Challenges**
1. **Physics Synchronization**: Keeping ball position consistent across clients
2. **Collision Detection**: Precise ball-object interactions
3. **Performance**: Maintaining 60fps with many objects
4. **Network Latency**: Handling lag in real-time gameplay

## 🏗️ Prototyping App Builder Pivot Concept (Exploration Phase)

### **Concept Overview**
Transform CollabCanvas into a visual prototyping app builder where canvas rectangles become React components. Users can create nested UI components, add logic flows, and deploy real web applications. This pivot leverages the existing real-time collaboration infrastructure to create a "Figma for web apps" that generates deployable code.

### **Core Features**
1. **Visual Component Design**
   - Canvas rectangles → React components (Button, Input, Text, Div, etc.)
   - Drag/drop component creation and positioning
   - Nested component support (parent-child relationships)
   - Component property panels for customization

2. **Logic Flow Builder**
   - ID-based data binding system
   - Visual connections between components
   - Input → computation → output logic flows
   - Helper functions: `getComponentValue(id)`, `setComponentValue(id, value)`

3. **AI Code Generation**
   - Generate JSX/TSX from visual component tree
   - Convert canvas objects to React components
   - Handle component nesting and properties
   - Generate deployable web applications

4. **Live App Deployment**
   - Dynamic routing: `<domain>/<username>/<appname>`
   - Real-time app generation and deployment
   - End-user authentication integration
   - Multi-tenant data architecture

### **Technical Architecture Decisions**
- **Component System**: Extend existing canvas objects with component properties
- **Nesting Logic**: Add `parent_id` column to canvas_objects table
- **AI Generation**: Simple JSX generation for prototyping (not enterprise-grade)
- **Deployment**: Next.js dynamic routes with generated code rendering
- **Multi-tenancy**: Compound key approach (app_owner_id, app_id, end_user_id)

### **Database Schema Extensions**
```sql
-- Apps table
CREATE TABLE apps (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  canvas_data JSONB, -- Component tree
  generated_code TEXT, -- AI-generated JSX/TSX
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- App data (multi-tenant)
CREATE TABLE app_data (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  app_id UUID REFERENCES apps(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id), -- App owner
  end_user_id UUID, -- End user of the app
  property_key TEXT,
  property_value JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add nesting support to existing canvas_objects
ALTER TABLE canvas_objects ADD COLUMN parent_id UUID REFERENCES canvas_objects(id);
```

### **Implementation Phases**
1. **Phase 1**: Component System (1-2 weeks)
   - Add `parent_id` column to canvas_objects
   - Update TypeScript interfaces
   - Component properties panel
   - Basic component types (Button, Input, Text, Div)

2. **Phase 2**: Logic & AI (1-2 weeks)
   - ID-based data binding system
   - Simple AI JSX generation
   - Helper functions for component interaction
   - Basic logic flow builder

3. **Phase 3**: Deployment (1 week)
   - Dynamic routing system
   - Database schema for apps and app_data
   - Basic RLS policies
   - App deployment pipeline

4. **Phase 4**: Polish (1-2 weeks)
   - Better AI prompts
   - More component types
   - UI improvements
   - Performance optimization

### **Migration Complexity Assessment**
- **Database Migration**: VERY EASY (1-2 days)
  - Most columns already exist in migration 007
  - Only need to add `parent_id` column
  - Existing canvas infrastructure handles complexity

- **TypeScript Updates**: EASY (1 day)
  - Extend existing CanvasObject interface
  - Add component-specific properties
  - Update canvas operations for nesting

- **Component System**: EASY (1-2 weeks)
  - Leverage existing object management
  - Add component property panels
  - Implement nesting logic

### **Key Technical Advantages**
1. **Existing Infrastructure**: Real-time collaboration, object management, user auth
2. **Simple Migration**: Database schema 90% ready, minimal changes needed
3. **Proven Architecture**: Dual-channel sync, batched updates, presence system
4. **Rapid Development**: 4-7 week timeline for full implementation

### **Unique Value Propositions**
1. **Visual to Code**: No coding required, just drag/drop components
2. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can design together
3. **Instant Deployment**: Generated apps are immediately accessible
4. **Multi-tenant**: Each app can have its own data and users
5. **AI-Powered**: Intelligent code generation from visual designs
