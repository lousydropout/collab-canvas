# Active Context: Current Development Focus

## Current Work Status
The CollabCanvas MVP is in **Phase 3: Collaboration** with core real-time features implemented and working. The project has successfully completed the foundational phases and user presence awareness, and is now focusing on state consistency and performance optimization.

## Recent Changes (Last Session)
- âœ… **Real-time Synchronization** - Object CRUD operations sync across clients
- âœ… **Ownership System** - Claim/release pattern prevents editing conflicts
- âœ… **Multiplayer Cursors** - Live cursor tracking with user names and colors
- âœ… **Presence Tracking** - Online user count and connection status
- âœ… **User List UI** - UserListModal component showing online users with avatars
- âœ… **Performance Optimization** - Separated broadcast from database operations

## Current Focus Areas

### 1. Auto-reconnect Bug Fix (PR #8)
**Status:** In Progress
- **Goal:** Ensure disconnected users auto reconnect without requiring page refresh
- **Implementation:** Improve Supabase realtime connection handling
- **Testing:** Test network disconnection and reconnection scenarios
- **User Experience:** Seamless reconnection without manual intervention

### 2. Periodic Delta Sync (PR #9)
**Status:** In Progress
- **Goal:** Ensure state consistency across disconnections
- **Implementation:** API endpoint for delta sync
- **Frequency:** Every 10 seconds, sync last 15 seconds of changes
- **Recovery:** Graceful reconnection with state sync

### 3. Performance Optimization (PR #10)
**Status:** Pending
- **Goal:** Maintain 60 FPS with 500+ objects
- **Optimizations:** Layer caching, viewport culling, debouncing
- **Testing:** Performance monitoring and stress testing
- **Targets:** <100ms object sync, <50ms cursor sync

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Dual Channel Architecture** - Using broadcast channels for CRUD operations and database subscriptions for ownership changes
2. **Optimistic UI** - Immediate feedback with server validation and rollback
3. **Konva.js Vanilla** - Direct API usage for optimal performance over react-konva

### Current Technical Challenges
1. **Delta Sync Implementation** - API design for efficient state synchronization
2. **Performance Testing** - Need comprehensive testing with many objects and users
3. **Error Recovery** - Better handling of network disconnections

### Next Immediate Steps
1. **Fix Auto-reconnect** - Ensure disconnected users reconnect automatically
2. **Implement Delta Sync API** - Server endpoint for state recovery
3. **Add Performance Monitoring** - Track FPS and sync latency
4. **Test with Multiple Users** - Verify 5+ user performance
5. **Polish UI/UX** - Improve visual feedback and user experience

## Current State Assessment

### What's Working Well
- âœ… Real-time object synchronization
- âœ… Ownership conflict prevention
- âœ… Smooth cursor tracking
- âœ… Connection status indicators
- âœ… Database persistence

### Areas Needing Attention
- ðŸ”„ Auto-reconnect functionality for disconnected users
- ðŸ”„ Delta sync for state consistency
- ðŸ”„ Performance optimization
- ðŸ”„ Error handling improvements
- ðŸ”„ UI/UX polish

### Known Issues
- **Database Events:** Some postgres_changes events may not be received (investigated in REALTIME_DEBUG.md)
- **Performance:** Need testing with 500+ objects
- **Error Recovery:** Need better handling of network disconnections

## Development Environment
- **Local Development:** Supabase running locally with `bunx supabase start`
- **Database:** Reset with `bunx supabase db reset` for clean state
- **Application:** Running with `bun dev` on localhost:3000
- **Testing:** Multi-browser testing for real-time features

## Success Metrics Tracking
- **Performance:** Monitoring FPS during interactions
- **Sync Latency:** Tracking object and cursor sync times
- **User Experience:** Testing with multiple concurrent users
- **Reliability:** Ensuring state consistency across disconnections
