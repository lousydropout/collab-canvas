- ✅ **Unified Transformation** - All shapes use same manipulation system
- ✅ **Enhanced Testing** - Added comprehensive testing guides

## Cancelled Features ❌

### PRs #9-11 Cancelled (Not Needed for MVP)

- ❌ **PR #9: Periodic Delta Sync** - Current sync mechanisms sufficient
- ❌ **PR #10: Performance Optimization** - Performance targets already met
- ❌ **PR #11: UI/UX Polish** - Core functionality complete

## Key Design Decisions Finalized

### 1. Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (not 14+)
- **Canvas Library:** react-konva (not vanilla Konva.js)
- **State Management:** React hooks only (no external state library)
- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui

### 2. User Experience Decisions

- **User List:** Modal popup (not sidebar)
- **Color System:** Full color picker (not black-only)
- **Ownership:** Creator owns objects initially (not "all")
- **Minimum Size:** 50x50px rectangles (not 20x20px)
- **Shape Support:** Both rectangles and ellipses

### 3. Architecture Decisions

- **Real-time:** Dual channel system (broadcast + database)
- **Ownership:** Direct database operations (not complex server functions)
- **Sync:** Automatic reconnection (not periodic delta sync)
- **Performance:** Batched updates with 16ms timer-based flushing
- **Race Prevention:** Objects must be selected and claimed before modification

## Current State Assessment ✅

### What's Working Perfectly

- ✅ Real-time object synchronization
- ✅ Ownership conflict prevention
- ✅ Smooth cursor tracking
- ✅ Connection status indicators
- ✅ Database persistence
- ✅ Multi-user collaboration
- ✅ Performance targets met
- ✅ Batched updates for smooth collaboration
- ✅ Presence consistency across reconnections
- ✅ Both rectangle and ellipse support

### No Critical Issues

- ✅ All MVP requirements satisfied
