# Product Context: CollabCanvas

## Why This Project Exists
CollabCanvas addresses the need for real-time collaborative design tools that allow multiple users to work together seamlessly on visual content. Traditional design tools lack true real-time collaboration, leading to version conflicts and inefficient workflows.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Version Conflicts** - Multiple users editing simultaneously without conflicts
2. **Real-time Awareness** - See what others are doing as they do it
3. **Seamless Collaboration** - No save/load cycles or manual sync
4. **Visual Communication** - Cursors and presence show who's working on what
5. **Conflict Prevention** - Ownership system prevents simultaneous edits

## How It Should Work
- **Instant Sync** - Changes appear immediately across all users
- **Visual Feedback** - Clear indicators for ownership, selection, and user presence
- **Smooth Performance** - 60 FPS even with many objects and users
- **Intuitive UX** - Familiar drag-and-drop interactions
- **Reliable State** - Data persists and syncs correctly after disconnections

## User Experience Goals
1. **Immediate Gratification** - Create rectangles instantly, see them sync immediately
2. **Spatial Awareness** - Know where other users are working via cursors
3. **Conflict-Free** - Never lose work due to simultaneous edits
4. **Performance** - Smooth interactions regardless of canvas complexity
5. **Reliability** - Works consistently across different network conditions

## Target Users
- **Design Teams** - Multiple designers working on layouts
- **Product Teams** - Collaborative wireframing and prototyping
- **Educators** - Interactive teaching with visual elements
- **Remote Teams** - Distributed collaboration on visual content

## Success Metrics
- **Engagement** - Users actively collaborating (not just viewing)
- **Performance** - Maintains 60 FPS with 500+ objects
- **Reliability** - <1% data loss or sync failures
- **Usability** - New users productive within 5 minutes
- **Scalability** - Supports 5+ concurrent users smoothly

## Future Vision
This MVP establishes the foundation for an AI-assisted design tool where:
- AI agents can participate in the collaboration
- Smart suggestions based on user patterns
- Automated layout optimization
- Natural language to visual element conversion
- Intelligent conflict resolution
